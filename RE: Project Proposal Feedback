1. Having only 1 year of data sucks, but I'm hoping that globalization will be enough to minimize seasonal fluctuations. For instance, I've noticed that staple means are fairly independent of season and go on sale every 2-3 weeks.
2. If the raw input data is the image of the weekly ad, then the features for a given data point would we (week, item name, item category, sale price, discount price, discount percentage, maybe nutrional info). I think I can use OCR on parts of the image to generate data points. But I might have to do it manually for other parts. Also, I don't plan on including every product. I only plan on including the regular staple food categories that I normally buy.
3. As a prediction problem, I want to be able to feed the model (item name) so that it will return to me (next sale date, next sale price). Alternatively, I would feed it (item category) so that it will return to me (item name, sale price) of next week's predicted deals for that food category.
